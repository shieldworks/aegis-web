## What Is **Aegis**?

[**Aegis**][aegis] is a **Kubernetes-native**, lightweight secrets manager 
that keeps your secrets secret. With **Aegis**, you can rest assured 
that your sensitive data is always **secure** and **protected**. 

Aegis is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at a 
central location and securely dispatching it to workloads.

By leveraging Kubernetes security primitives, [SPIRE][spire], and strong,
industry-standard encryption, **Aegis** ensures that your secrets are **only** 
accessible to **trusted** and **authorized** workloads. **Aegis**‚Äôs 
Cloud Native‚Äîsecure by default‚Äîfoundation helps you safeguard your business 
and protect against data breaches.

[Check out **Aegis**‚Äôs *GitHub* for details][aegis-github].

## Where **NOT** to Use Aegis

Aegis is **not** a Database, nor is it a distributed caching layer. Of course,
you may tweak it to act like one if you try hard enough, yet, that is
generally not a good use of the tool.

Aegis is suitable for storing secrets and dispatching them; however, it
is a *terrible* idea to use it as a centralized database to store everything
but the kitchen sink.

Use **Aegis** to store service keys, database credentials, access tokens,
etc.


## How Do I Get the Root Token? Where Do I Store It?

Unlike some other secret vaults, you do not need an admin token
to operate **Aegis** üôÇ.

Benefits of this approach is: It helps the Ops team `#sleepmore`, since
everything is automated, and you won‚Äôt have to manually unlock **Aegis** upon
a system crash, for example.

However, there‚Äôs no free lunch, and as the operator of a production system,
your homework is to secure access to your cluster. [Check out the **Production 
Deployment Guidelines**][production] for further instructions about hardening your 
cluster to securely use **Aegis**.

## Installation

First, ensure that you have sufficient administrative rights on your 
**Kubernetes** cluster. Then create a workspace folder and clone the project.
And finally execute the `./hack/install.sh` as follows.

```bash 
mkdir $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
export $WORKSPACE=$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE

cd $WORKSPACE

git clone https://github.com/zerotohero-dev/aegis
cd aegis

./hack/install.sh
```

Additionally, you can deploy a demo workload to experiment:

```bash 
# Demo workload that uses `aegis-sidecar` 
./hack/install-workload-using-sidecar.sh

# Demo workload that directly talks to `aegis-safe` 
# using Aegis Go SDK
./hack/install-workload-using-sdk.sh
```

To verify installation check out the `aegis-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n aegis-system

# Output:
#
# NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
# aegis-safe       1/1     1            1
# aegis-sentinel   1/1     1            1
```

That‚Äôs it. You are all set ü§ò.

## Uninstalling Aegis

Uninstallation can be done by running a script:

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis 
./hack/uninstall.sh
```
