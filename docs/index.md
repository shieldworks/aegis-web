## What Is **Aegis**?

[**Aegis**][aegis] is a **Kubernetes-native**, lightweight, secrets management 
framework that keeps your secrets secret. With **Aegis**, you can rest assured 
that your sensitive data is always **secure** and **protected**. 

Aegis is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at a 
central location and securely dispatching it to workloads.

By leveraging Kubernetes security primitives, [SPIRE][spire], and strong,
industry-standard encryption, **Aegis** ensures that your secrets are **only** 
accessible to **trusted** and **authorized** workloads. **Aegis**‚Äôs 
Cloud Native, secure by default, foundation helps you safeguard your business 
and protect against data breaches.

[Check out **Aegis**‚Äôs *GitHub* for details][aegis-github].

## Installation

First, ensure that you have sufficient administrative rights on your 
**Kubernetes** cluster. Then create a workspace folder and clone the project.
And finally execute the `./hack/install.sh` as follows.

```bash 
mkdir $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
export $WORKSPACE=$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE

cd $WORKSPACE

git clone https://github.com/zerotohero-dev/aegis
cd aegis

./hack/install.sh
```

Additionally, you can deploy a demo workload to experiment:

```bash 
# Demo workload that uses `aegis-sidecar` 
./hack/install-workload-using-sidecar.sh

# Demo workload that directly talks to `aegis-safe` 
# using Aegis Go SDK
./hack/install-workload-using-sdk.sh
```

To verify installation check out the `aegis-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n aegis-system

# Output:
#
# NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
# aegis-safe       1/1     1            1
# aegis-sentinel   1/1     1            1
```

That‚Äôs it. You are all set ü§ò.

## Uninstalling Aegis

Uninstallation can be done by running a script:

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis
