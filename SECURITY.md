# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of **Aegis**
is currently being supported with security updates.

Note that **Aegis** consists of more than a single project,
and during a release cut, all projects are signed and tagged
with the same version.

Afer **Aegis** hits a major 1.0.0. version, this will change
and we will also have a support plan various major versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send your vulnerability reports to [me@volkan.io](mailto:me@volkan.io).

We don’t have an official turnover time, but if nobody gets back
to you within a week please send another email.

Feel free to send a notification to us at the `#aegis-security` channel
on [the Aegis Slack Workspace][slack].

[slack]: https://join.slack.com/t/aegis-6n41813/shared_invite/zt-1myzqdi6t-jTvuRd1zDLbHX0gN8VkCqg

We do our best to respond and support in a timely fashion, 
but because of… well, “everything”, there might be delays.

However, we take all vulnerability reports seriously and you will be notified 
if your report is accepted or declined, and what further actions we are going
to take on it.
